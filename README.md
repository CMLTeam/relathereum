# Relathereum
Hackathon Stuttgart 2019

**Problem:**
Find a place to rest and refresh when you’re on the go.

**Solution:**
An infrastructure concept of **mobile capsular houses** that can be deployed in transport hubs and event spots. 
The condition of capsules is getting tracked in **Ethereum-based platform** we’ve built.
And with our mobile app you can:
- find the capsule nearby,
- verify if it is in a good condition,
- unlock it and pay “as you stay” with payment algorithm defined in our **smart contracts**.
